## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`<media-player>`, the first cut.** One custom element over the `<audio>` or `<video>`
  already in the page. Which of the two it wrapped decides the video half — poster, overlay,
  captions, fullscreen and controls that fade while playing — read off the child element
  rather than off a `src`, so there is never a moment where the page has no media element in
  it. Play, pause, stop, skip, seek, volume — slider or `volumeUp`/`volumeDown` buttons —
  mute, buffering and live-stream detection; volume, mute and captions state remembered per
  `storage-key`.

- **The controls are the author's markup.** No generated control bar and no option that
  takes one: buttons and range inputs are written in the page and wired by name through
  [hydrargyri](https://github.com/stamat/hydrargyri) — `on` for what fires, `bind` for where
  state lands. The `controls` attribute the author wrote stays on the media element until
  the element upgrades, so a script that never loads leaves a working native player.

- **The look is optional.** Structure and look ship as separate stylesheets, the way the
  elementals do: `style.css` alone is a working player, and `theme.css` brings the flat
  compact bar, the accent flooding a button on hover, the slim track whose thumb appears on
  hover or focus, the video gradient with its centred play chip, a stripe march while
  buffering and a scrubber that hides on a live stream — in `Canvas` and `CanvasText`
  rather than hardcoded white and slate, so dark mode and forced colours need no palette.

- **The parts with an APG pattern are borrowed, not rewritten.** The scrubber and volume are
  [`<slider-elemental>`](https://github.com/stamat/book-of-elementals) around a native
  `<input type="range">`, the buffered bar is `<progress-elemental buffer>`, and the control
  row is `<toolbar-elemental>`. This element writes no `role` and no `aria-valuenow` of its
  own.
